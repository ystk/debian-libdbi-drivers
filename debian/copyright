Packager note (Thomas Goirand <thomas@goirand.fr>):
	Most of the packages here are released using LGPL. Some documentation
	are released using GFDL (eg drivers/mysql & drivers/pgsql), but with no
	invariant section, so they are seen as free in the eyes of Debian.
	Others have no documentation notice at all, so they are supposedly
	released with the same license as the library themself (eg: LGPL or GPL
	depending on the driver). This particular topic has been confirmed by
	the project admin, Markus Hoenicka.
