libdbi-drivers (0.8.2-1-4.1) unstable; urgency=high

  * Non-maintainer upload with maintainer's approval.
  * High urgency upload for RC bugfix.
  * Pass --freetds-inc-dir to configure, to bypass the ridiculous upstream
    AC_FIND_FILE() checks for files that *aren't used during the build*;
    fixes a build failure with FreeTDS 0.82.  Closes: #493349.

libdbi-drivers (0.8.2-1-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Updated the dbd_pgsql.c so it doesn't conflicts with the declaration of
    pg_encoding_to_char() that is now declared in libpq-fe.h: it was not
    declared in previous API (Closes: #462511)
  * Added (>= 8.3~rc2-1+b1) for the libpq-dev build-depends so there is no risk
    of FTBFS with the earlier version of the postgresql lib.
  * Bumped Standards-Version to 3.7.3
  * Fixed debian/*.doc-base indentation, and changed from Apps/Programming to
    Applications/Programming, as it has to be now.
  * Bumped compat level to 6.
